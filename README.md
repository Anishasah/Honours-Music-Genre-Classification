**Music Genre Classification Project**

**Overview**  
This project aims to classify music genres using machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on audio feature extraction and neural network modeling.

**Features**  
Load and preprocess audio data.  
Extract various audio features such as Mel spectrograms and chroma features.  
Visualize audio features using spectrograms and chromagrams.  
Analyze correlations between audio features.  
Train neural network models with different architectures using TensorFlow/Keras.  
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.  
Visualize model predictions using confusion matrices.  

**Getting Started**  
Clone the repository.  

**Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project contains audio samples from various music genres, such as blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock.

**Preprocessing**  
Audio data is preprocessed to extract features using the Librosa library.  
Features are normalized and scaled before feeding into the neural network models.  

**Model Architecture**  
Multiple neural network architectures are implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.  
Models vary in the number of layers, activation functions, and optimizer choices.  

**Evaluation**  
Model performance is evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Confusion matrices are generated to visualize model predictions and identify classification errors.
